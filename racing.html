    <p>F1 racing is all about innovation. All teams are trying to not only win the most races but aslo develop the fastest, most high-tech car. These cars have hundreds of moving parts, all geared to win! Millions upon millions of dollars are spent to shave off racers times by a fraction of a second. It is a sport that perfectly combines technology, and innovatation, with competitiveness.</p>

    <h2>Why follow F1 when I can just watch more traditional sports such as basketball or football?</h2>
        <p>F1 is a sport that is constantly changing. From week to week, teams can change the cars to make them faster, lighter, or more aerodynamic. Here is Marques Brownlee explaining why F1 racing is so cool, and why you should follow it just as closely as you would any other sport.</p>

<div class="centertext"><h3> So, lets recap why F1 is worth your time:</h3></div>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li> It is a car race! Cars flying around a track full of tight turns and curves at upwards of 200 miles per hour is quite frankly just amazing.</li>
        <li> It is the worlds highest-end tech competition.</li>
    <ul> 
            <li>Each team is alloted a budget. In 2023, teams were allocated 135 million dollars to assemble their cars.</li>
            <li> With this money, teams assemble their cars, provide maintenace throughout the season, and provide the neccesary travel, and logistics to support the car, the racers, and the team.</li>
    </ul>
        <li> Most sports tend to focus on the athletes, the players are the ones who hoist the trophy at the end of the year and they usually get all the credit. In F1, the racers compete for the Drivers Championship, while the team competes for the Constructors championship. Not only are racers tryinbg to get around the track the fastest, but the team that supports them is trying to build the most high tech car.</li>
        <li> Teams and mechanics are encouraged to improve their cars from week to week, being constantly focused on making their car as fast as possible. Innovation is required for success. In fact, it is encouraged.</li>
    </ol>
